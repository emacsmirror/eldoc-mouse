# eldoc-mouse

`eldoc-mouse` is an Emacs package that enhances the `eldoc` functionality by displaying documentation in a child frame at the mouse point using [posframe](https://github.com/tumashu/posframe) when the mouse hovers over a symbol in an `eglot` managed buffer. It integrates with `posframe` to provide popup documentation and features a debounced hover mechanism to prevent excessive requests to the LSP server.

## Features
- Displays documentation in a child frame when hovering over symbols in `eglot` managed buffers.
- Integrates with `posframe` for popup documentation.
- Avoids spamming the LSP server by debouncing hover events.
- Works in `prog-mode` buffers to show documentation for the symbol under the mouse point.
- Removed the unnecessary signatures from the document to make doucment more clear.
- Still keep highlighting the symbol under the cursor.
