# eldoc-mouse

`eldoc-mouse` is an Emacs package that enhances the `eldoc` functionality by displaying documentation in a child frame at the mouse point using [posframe](https://github.com/tumashu/posframe) when the mouse hovers over a symbol in an `eglot` managed buffer. It integrates with `posframe` to provide popup documentation and features a debounced hover mechanism to prevent excessive requests to the LSP server.
